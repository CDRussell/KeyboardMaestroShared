# Keyboard Maestro - Shared Macros

## About this repo
[Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) is a fantastic productivity tool for Macs, letting you customize the hell out of your machine. 

It's a pre-requisite for using anything shared in this repo.

This is a collection of macros I've created because I've found them useful.

## Importing macros
To import, use the File menu inside the `Keyboard Maestro`, and choose `Import Macros Disabled`

This will allow you to select a `*.kmmacros` file and import it. It will be disabled by default inside KM, so you'll need to enable it before it'll work.

Also, it'll come with the keyboard shortcut keys I've used embedded in it, so you'll probably want to edit that in KeyboardMaestro after you've imported it.
